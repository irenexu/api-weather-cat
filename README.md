# data-manipulation-and-analysis-api-weather-cat

This repository contains code and templates for creating a simple webpage/application that displays the current time, weather, and forecast, along with some random cat images. It serves as supporting material for Exercise IV - Explore the Use of APIs & Image Analysis (https://github.com/irenexu/data-manipulation-and-analysis).

# template

The webpage template is obtained from html5up.net | @ajlkn

Modification has been made to index.html only (both HTML and Javascript) to intergrate The Cat and Unsplash APIs.
(ChatGPT has been used regarding how to using JavaScript Fetch API )

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

Demo images** courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Delete index-demo.html and assets/js/demo.js when you're done messing with the demo
as neither are needed in production :)
